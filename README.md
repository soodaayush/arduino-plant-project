# Inspiration

This was my project for my Advanced Biology 11 independent study, where an experiment had to be conducted on plants. The experiment revolved around pouring three different liquids on plants, water, orange juice, and milk, and measuring how it affects the bioelectric signals in the plants.

# Challenges

The challenges conisisted of determining the most efficient method to measuring electricity in plants and making sure to keep little interference from the environment.

# Lessons Learned

I learned how plants react to stimuli, by using signals. As different liquids are poured on the plants, they respond through bioelectric signals as there is a change in enviornment along with other factors.

# Results

In summary, water maintained near-constant bioelectric activity, orange juice increased bioelectric activity, and milk decreased bioelectric activity.
